=== Linux System Access and File System ===

VirtualBox full screen: left CTRL+F 
Host name: linuxvm
root: ToorDev
devlab: embdev

Linux remote access: Putty, SecureCRT, SSH from Linux to Linux (SSH: Secure Shell)
Network: Host-only Adapter - allows communication between PC and VM
*** IP ***
  $ ifconfig
  $ ip a
  $ ip addr
  $ ifup <adapter name>   % Connect via adapter
  
*** File System ***
  File system types: ext3, ext4, XFS, NTFS, FAT, etc.
  root                  = /
  boot loader           = /boot             % grub.cfg
  root user home        = /root
  attached devices      = /dev
  config files          = /etc
  everyday usr commands = /bin->/usr/bin    % linked
  system commands       = /sbin->/usr/sbin
  optional add-on APPs  = /opt              % not part of the OS
  running processes     = /proc             % exist only in memory
  C library             = /lib->usr/lib     % needed by commands and APPs
  temporary files       = /tmp
  user directory        = /home
  commands              = /usr/bin
  system logs           = /var
  system deamons        = /run              % start very early (e.g. systemd and udev) to store temporary runtime files like PID files
  mount ext filesys     = /mnt              % e.g. NTFS
  for CDROM mounts      = /media
                   
*** Navigation Commands ***  
  $ cd <DirectoryName> % change directory
  $ cd % changes to home directory
  $ pwd % print working directory
  $ ls % list files/directories
  /         = absolute path
  WITHOUT / = relative path
  
*** Directory Listing Attributes ***
  $ ls -l % <Type> <# of Links> <Owner> <Group> <Size> <--DATE--> <Name>
  $ ls -ltr
  
*** Creating Files and Directories ***
  $ touch % create new file
  $ cp % copy file
  $ vi % VI editor => See the details in Linux Basics
  $ mkdir % create directory
  
*** Linux File Types ***
=> 7 different file types
  - % Regular file
  d % Directory
  l % Link
  c % Special file or device file
  s % Socket
  p % Named pipe
  b % Block device
  
*** Find Files and Directories ***
  $ find . -name "<FileName>"
  $ yum install mlocate
  $ updatedb
  $ locate <FileName>
  $ find / -name "ifcfg-enp0s3"
  locate: uses prebuilt database which should be regularly updated (i.d. $ updatedb)
  find: iterates over a filesystem to locate files
  locate vs find: locate is much faster, but can be inaccurete if the database in the cache is not updated
   
*** Find Files and Directories ***
  $ passwd <UserID>           % Change password
  $ passwd -f <UserID>        % Change forced password

*** WildCards ***
  WildCard: id a character that can be used as a subtitute for any of a class of characters in a search
  *  - zero or more characters
  ?  - single character
  [] - range of characters
  \  - escape character
  ^  - the beginning of the line
  $  - the end of the line
  $ touch abc{1..9}-xyz.txt     % creates 9 files
  $ rm abcd*
  $ ls -l ?bcd*
  $ ls -l *[cd]*
  $ ls -l *[789]*
  $ ls -ltr *[789]*
  $ ls -l *[cd]* | more
  
*** Soft and Hard Links ***
  inode         = Pointer or number of a file on the hard disk
  SoftLink      = Link will be removed if file  is removed or renamed
  HardLink      = Deletin/renaming or moving the original fill won't be affect the hard link
  $ ln          % Create HardLink - Works only within the same partition
  $ ln -s       % create SoftLink
  Example:
    <HardLink> -> <inode> <- <file> <- <SoftLink>
  $ mkdir Work && cd Work
  $ touch hulk
  $ ls -li  % inode of file
